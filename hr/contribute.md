Želiš doprinijeti razvoju Gaphora? Ako misliš da je ovo samo za iskusne
programere, ne brini. Postoji mnogo načina kako doprinijeti Gaphoru, bez
obzira na razinu iskustva ili vještine.

Our [technical documentation](https://gaphor.readthedocs.io) is hosted on
the wonderful service that is [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.com/). Not
only does it contain details needed in order to make code contributions to
Gaphor, but it outlines plenty of other ways in which you can contribute
(including making updates to this website). Finally, it provides a guide to
our processes and expectations for the various types of contribution you can
make to Gaphor.

The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor).

If in doubt, just ask in our <a href="../discuss">discussion area</a> and
someone will be able to point you in the right direction.
