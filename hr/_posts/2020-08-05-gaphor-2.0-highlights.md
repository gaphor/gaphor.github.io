Gaphor 2.0 includes some big new features. They were a long time in the
making, since most of the development work for Gaphor 1.2 was to lay the
groundwork for the changes we wanted to implement for 2.0.

With 49 [Pull
requests](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed++milestone%3A2.0.0)
on GitHub, this is by far the biggest release we've done so far.

So, what am I excited about you ask? Well, how about:

* SysML support
* Customizable style
* Copy/paste functionality
* New application logo

## SysML support

By introducing SysML, Gaphor now has (basic) support for systems
engineering.  This new modeling language has been added as a module to the
application, therefore, it's also possible to add other modeling languages,
either as part of Gaphor or as separately distributed plugins.

## Customizable style

Previously, all diagrams in Gaphor were black and white. For this release,
we added a CSS styling engine that allow you to add color to your
diagrams. There are some powerful styling options that allow you to
implement consistent and aesthetically pleasing styles across your
model. You can find more examples in the [technical
documentation](https://gaphor.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0/style_sheets.html)

I may have overdone it for the screenshot, but you get the idea, right?

## Copy/paste functionality

Copy/paste functionality has been part of Gaphor for some time. However, it
only worked if you did a copy operation and then pasted it directly
after. It would fail if you removed a couple of items, or made other
changes, between the copy and paste. This update made the copying and
pasting much more robust. Now Gaphor makes an internal copy of the diagram
item *and* the underlying model element. In an upcoming version you should
be able to copy/paste between diagrams as well.

## New application logo

It's 2020 and the old logo dated back from the early 2000's. So it was about
time for a new fresh logo.

We hope you'll enjoy using Gaphor as much as we enjoy building it. [Give it
