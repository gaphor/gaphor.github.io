It's good to talk, share knowledge and learn from other users of
Gaphor. Perhaps you have a question, problem or are unsure how to do
something with Gaphor? Discussing such things in a supportive environment is
a good way to make progress, make friends, and help. Put simply, Gaphor is a
community focused project, and we have created a couple of online spaces
where the community can come together.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from anyone irrespective of age,
gender, religion, race, or sexuality. If you’re thinking, "but they don't
mean me", then we especially mean YOU.

## Chat on Gitter

Our real-time conversations are on Gitter and are bridged to Matrix.  Matrix
is the preferred way, since it's more use friendly than bare Gitter.

[<img src="/images/matrix_org.svg" alt="matrix.org" style="height: 1em" /> Join Matrix with Element.io](https://app.element.io/#/room/#gaphor_Lobby:gitter.im)

NB. If you're using a mobile device, use the [Element
app](https://element.io/get-started) (for Matrix), the Gitter app is no
longer supported.
