If you have the latest stable version of Python installed and the Gaphor
dependencies installed, you can also install Gaphor using a wheel from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gaphor/).

If you don't have the latest stable version of Python and the Gaphor
dependencies installed, follow the development environment [installation
instructions](https://docs.gaphor.org/en/latest) section, but do not
clone the repository. Optionally, create a [virtual
environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments).
Then execute the following:

```bash
pip install gaphor
gaphor
```
