Translation of Gaphor is mostly done using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/gaphor/).
For the Linux Flatpak, the desktop entry comment string can be translated at our [Flatpak repository](https://github.com/flathub/org.gaphor.Gaphor/blob/master/share/org.gaphor.Gaphor.desktop).
Thank you so much for your effort in helping us keep it available in many languages!
