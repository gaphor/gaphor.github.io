Title: Discuss

It's good to talk, share knowledge and learn from other users of Gaphor. Perhaps
you have a question, problem or are unsure how to do something with Gaphor?
Discussing such things in a supportive environment is a good way to make
progress, make friends and make a success of things. Put simply, Gaphor is a
community focused project and we have created an online discussion group where
the community can come together.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from anyone irrespective of age,
gender, religion, race, or sexuality. If you’re thinking, "but they don't mean
me", then we especially mean YOU.

Our discussion platform is provided Gitter and you can sign-up and connect with
