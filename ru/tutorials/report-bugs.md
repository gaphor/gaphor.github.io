If you've ever written a line of code, you'll know that all software has
bugs.  This will also be the case with Gaphor. If you think you have found a
bug, simply click on the link below (you'll need to have an account on
GitHub) and then click the green "New Issue" button found at the top right
hand side of the page:

[Report a Bug in Gaphor](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/issues)

When you create a new issue it will be given a number and the volunteer
developers, who write and maintain the code, will be informed by email. They
may annotate questions to your issue, if things are not clear. They may
immediately close it and mark it as "duplicate" (someone else has already
reported the bug -- and they'll reference the original issue). Sometimes
they'll close the bug and say "won't fix", because they disagree that it's a
bug *or* it's too trivial in order to invest any time.

There are generally two sorts of bugs:

* Technical: the code has a mistake in it which causes the program to break.
* Behavioural: the code works correctly, but is doing the wrong thing.

In both cases, for us to be able to fix the bug, we need **as much
information as possible**. When you create a new issue you should try to
include, where relevant, the following sorts of information:

* What you were trying to do,
* What steps you took to make this happen,
* What you expected to happen,
* What actually happened,
* Why this difference is problematic (it may not be a bug!),
* Technical details like the version of Gaphor you're using, your OS version
  and other aspects of the context in which Gaphor was running.

Use plain and simple language to describe the problem and, if helpful, break
it down into steps so developers can easily recreate the issue. Please don't
assume we'll understand what you were trying to achieve -- honestly, it's
best if you try to imagine we (the developers) are a bunch of clever
5-year-olds. Try to explain *everything* about the problem and don't assume
we know what you mean.  We won't mind!

If you would like to get more involved in the development of Gaphor, we'd
love to welcome you via the [Gaphor developer's
website](http://docs.gaphor.org).
