It's good to talk, share knowledge and learn from other users of Gaphor. Perhaps
you have a question, problem or are unsure how to do something with Gaphor?
Discussing such things in a supportive environment is a good way to make
progress, make friends, and help. Put simply, Gaphor is a community focused
project, and we have created a couple of online spaces where the community can
come together.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from anyone irrespective of age,
gender, religion, race, or sexuality. If youâ€™re thinking, "but they don't mean
me", then we especially mean YOU.

## Chat on Gitter

Our real-time conversations are on Gitter and are bridged to Matrix.
Matrix is the preferred way, since it's more use friendly than bare Gitter.

[<img src="/images/matrix_org.svg" alt="matrix.org" style="height: 1em" /> Join Matrix with Element.io](https://app.element.io/#/room/#gaphor_Lobby:gitter.im)

NB. If you're using a mobile device, use the [Element app](https://element.io/get-started) (for Matrix), the Gitter app is no longer supported.

## Community Conduct

We expect contributors to follow the GNOME [Code of
Conduct](https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/CodeOfConduct).

We want our community to be a safe, welcoming and friendly place.
We won't hesitate to issue a clear warning and, if ignored, ban people who don't
behave in the spirit of the code of conduct. If a conduct related situation arises, we
will endeavour to act in a discreet, sympathetic and fair manner to all
concerned.
