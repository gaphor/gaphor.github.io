It's good to talk, share knowledge and learn from other users of Gaphor. Perhaps
you have a question, problem or are unsure how to do something with Gaphor?
Discussing such things in a supportive environment is a good way to make
progress, make friends, and help. Put simply, Gaphor is a community focused
project, and we have created a couple of online spaces where the community can
come together.

Contributions are welcome without prejudice from anyone irrespective of age,
gender, religion, race, or sexuality. If youâ€™re thinking, "but they don't mean
me", then we especially mean YOU.

## Chat on [matrix]

Our real-time conversations are on [matrix]. You can join using a chat client
like Element, Fractal, or one of the other many options.
