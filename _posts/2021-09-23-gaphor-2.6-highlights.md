With Gaphor 2.6 we improved "under the hood". We improved on the saving/loading
stability. Added multiple translations and improved the Windows version of
Gaphor.

## Model stability

Over the past few months, we received a couple of issues where users were not
able to open a model after saving it. Although we incorporated improvements in
[Gaphor 2.5](/2021/07/02/gaphor-2.5-highlights.html), there was a few lingering
issues to be fixed for this release as well. With Gaphor 2.6, we expect that
things are now fairly stable with opening models.

## Translations

With help of [ovari](https://github.com/ovari) we started using
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/gaphor/gaphor/) to manage
translations for Gaphor. As a result, Gaphor now speaks a few more languages
including Finnish, Galician, Hungarian, and Korean. The Spanish translation also
got a nice update.

## Windows build more native

We made the Windows build more native as well. Previously, we used MSYS2 as the
basis for our Windows distribution. The downside was that the (patched) Python
version distributed with MSYS2 tried to behave like a Unix version in a Windows
world. Now we're using the Windows Python and GTK compiled for the windows
platform.

## 2.6.1

Our first patch release in the 2.6 series (to be released) contains many small
fixes, from unintentionally rotating Join bars to name and icon updates.

Many thanks go to [Zsolt Sandor](https://github.com/sz332) for bringing our
attention to many of the small glitches in Gaphor. His thorough QA found a fair
amount issues, of which most of them are fixed in 2.6.1.

With those fixes in, we can confidently state that 2.6.1 will be the best
release so far. At least until 2.7 is released ;).

### Update 2021-10-04

In quick succession we released a couple of patch-releases. These releases focused
on localization (translations). Thanks to [ovari](https://github.com/ovari) we have
added localization support for pretty much every text used in Gaphor. Be it UI text, stereotypes, or type default names.
