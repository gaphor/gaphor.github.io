Roughly a month after our 2.7 release we're happy to announce Gaphor 2.8.

Gaphor 2.7 added a Sphinx extension and better support for sequence diagrams.
2.8 adds a whole set of new features, starting with a welcome screen and a couple
of project templates to bootstrap your models.

Here are some highlights.

<!--break-->

## Welcome screen

To get your modeling started, Gaphor now provides a few templates:

* _UML_, a basic UML project structure.
* _SysML_, a basic SysML project structure using 3 abstraction levels.
* _RAAML_, a basic RAAML project structure for FTA and STPA.
* _C4 model_, with the model layers as described on https://c4model.com.
* _Generic_, a blank starting model.

The [OMG](https://omg.org) gave us permission to use the official logos. Really cool!

This is just a start. If you're using a template you think would be useful to
have available in Gaphor (and you think it will be equally useful to other
users), please [open a feature
request](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/issues).

## Diagram types

Previously, Gaphor had only one generic diagram type. To provide you with a
little more guidance (and because you asked for it), we introduced support for
different diagram types. Each diagram type has a preferred set of tools in the
toolbox, and when you open a diagram it will automatically collapse the less
frequently used ones. For UML there is Class diagram, Sequence diagram, and
Activity diagram types, to name a few.

## Magnet tool

A new tool "magnet" has been introduced. It can be used as a, well, magnet, to
push and pull the right or lower section of your diagram. This allows you to
make a little room somewhere in the middle of your diagram, or close a gap in
your diagram.

## Keep model elements around

Previously, Gaphor always tried to keep the underlying model in sync with the
contents of its diagrams. For Gaphor 2.8 we relaxed this requirement a little.
It is now possible to keep model elements around even if they aren't used on any
diagram, by changing a setting in the preference section. The default setting is
still to keep both in sync. This setting is on a per-model basis.

While we were busy we also improved the behavior when it comes to deleting
diagrams. Instead of showing you a confirmation dialog, Gaphor will just do as
you ask (remove the diagram). A notification is shown to make you aware elements
have been removed from the model. This same message will also appear whenever
something is implicitly removed from the model.

## AppImage and Homebrew

The Gaphor [AppImage]({{ "/download/#appimage" | prepend: site.baseurl }} %}) has been built against Ubuntu
18.04. This means that, unless your running a really ancient version of Linux,
you should be able to run Gaphor from an AppImage.

For macOS users: Gaphor can now also be installed via
[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/gaphor).

## Other stuff

Many improvements have been made in model consistency. We rebuilt our code
generator that creates the underlying data for models, made improvements to how
Gaphor saves and loads models, and improved undo functionality.

For a full list, check the [release on
GitHub](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/releases).

All in all this is a pretty good release. Although a lot of features have been
added, the code has become more concise and clean. A sign that Gaphor is on the
right track.

Many thanks to all who contributed!
