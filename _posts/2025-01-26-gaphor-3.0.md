Gaphor 3.0 has officially been released, marking an exciting new chapter for this modeling tool. This update brings
significant enhancements, particularly in the user interface and the modularity of supported modeling languages.

For a complete overview of all changes, you can check out the
[changelog](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) or visit the
[Gaphor Release](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/releases) page.

<!--break-->

As always, this release makes use of the latest versions of [GTK 4](https://gtk.org) and
[libadwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita).

## User Interface Improvements

This release features a redesigned user interface inspired by feedback from a research paper published by the University
of Mannheim. The paper, titled
[MBSE tooling for neurodivergent system architects
(German)](https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/66242/1/Benutzeroberfl%C3%A4chen%20von%20MBSE-Tools%20und%20deren%20Auswirkung%20auf%20neurodivergente%20Systemarchitekten.pdf),
used Gaphor as a case study. By collaborating with the authors, the Gaphor team applied these insights to make the
application simpler and more intuitive.

Key UI enhancements include:

* Streamlined Header Bar Layout: Improved organization for easier navigation.
* Global Settings: Settings that were previously model-specific are now accessible as application-wide configurations.
* New Diagram Quick Toolbar: Provides rapid access to common operations.
* Enhanced Model Browser: Double-clicking a model element now highlights it in the diagram rather than adding it redundantly.

Many thanks to [Mareike Keil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mareike-keil-7600b4226/) from the University of Mannheim for
her invaluable insights and contributions.

## Modeling language Advancements
Historically, Gaphor’s primary focus has been on UML, which served as the foundation for extensions like SysML (v1) and
RAAML. However, the development of SysML v2 introduced new challenges. Unlike its predecessor, SysML v2 is not based on
UML, prompting the need for a fresh approach.

Initially, the team attempted to create a shared foundation for UML and SysML. However, this approach resulted in
fragmenting the UML model and added complexity. Recognizing the need for flexibility, Gaphor’s core was restructured to
be modeling language agnostic. This transformation enables the implementation of diverse modeling languages, including
SysML v2, ontology models, and ER diagrams, without relying on UML as a base.

A huge shoutout to [Paul C. Brown](https://github.com/pbrown12303) for his guidance and support in making this shift
possible.
