Finally, Gaphor 3.0 has been released.

The major changes in this release include an improved user interface and better modularity for modeling languages.


In this post we dive into the highlights of the 3.0 release,
The [change log](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) contains a more complete set of changes,
as does the [Gaphor Release](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/releases).

<!--break-->

As always, the releases are based on the latest [GTK 4](https://gtk.org) and
[LibAdwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita) releases.

## UI improvements

We've improved the user interface, based on a paper from the Uni of Mannheim about the use
of [MBSE tooling for neurodivergent system architects (German)](https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/66242/1/Benutzeroberfl%C3%A4chen%20von%20MBSE-Tools%20und%20deren%20Auswirkung%20auf%20neurodivergente%20Systemarchitekten.pdf).
In this paper Gaphor was used as one example. We contacted the authors and applied the feedback in this
version of Gaphor. As a result things are simpler and the UI behaves more as one would expect.

The improvements include

* Better layout of the header bar
* Settings previously done on model level are now application wide settings
* A tool bar for common operations
* Double-clicking a model element in the Model Browser now highlights it in the diagram, and no longer adds it.

Many thanks to [Mareike Keil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mareike-keil-7600b4226/) from the Uni of Mannheim for collecting the feedback.

## Modeling languages

Historically, Gaphor modeling language have always been based on UML. UML was the first ML implemented, and forms the
basis for languages like SysML (v1) and RAAML.

While we were investigating how to implement SysML v2, we ran into an issue: SysML v2 has been built from the ground up
and is not based on UML. Our initial attempt was to build a common base for both UML and SysML, but this resulted in
a confusing situation where the UML model was spread out over several models.

This was clearly not the way forward. With the help of Paul Brown we managed to make the Gaphor core modeling language
agnostic. Now we can implement any modeling language. This means that we can implement SysML v2, onthology models, ER models
without the need to base it on UML.

Credits go to Paul Brown for his help and guidance on this endavour.
