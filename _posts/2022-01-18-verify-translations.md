Gaphor has translations in more than a dozen languages. Not all translations
are 100%, and in most cases that’s not a problem. Thanks to the power of Open
Source, everyone can contribute with translations for your project.

After our latest release we found out, by a user, that one of the translations
had an error. “An error?”, I hear you ask, “How is that possible?”

<!--break-->

First some background.

A common tool for translations is
[Gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/). Translations are maintained
in `.po` files, portable object files. Those files typically contain the
original text and a translation.

```gettext
msgid "I’m a message"
msgstr "Ik ben een bericht"
```

The `msgid` contains the original text. For most applications that’s the text
in American English. The `msgstr` contains the translated text. If `msgstr`
contains no translation (it’s and empty string `""`), the original text is
used.

Translated text is not only _just text_. Sometimes this text contains
placeholders that have to be filled in by the application. Think of things like
version numbers, or a file name. We learned that hard way that an error is
easily made.

The way placeholders are formatted depends on the language. In C, texts contain
`%`-mark expressions (`I counted %d items`). Javascript uses a different
format: `I counted ${count} items`<sup>[1](#note1)</sup>. In Python the
C-style can be used (old style) as well as curly-bracket placehodlers with the
`str.format()` method: `I counted {count} items`.

Now assume the text `I counted {count} items` has to be translated. The term
`count` is case-sensitive. For example, a slight error in the Dutch translation
could cause an unintended error in the application: `Ik telde {Count} items`.

To avoid errors we created [a small
script](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/blob/master/po/check-babel.py), using
[Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/). Babel is a Python based internationalization
library. Using babel, we read the translations from a `.po` file and check if
all placeholders from the original text (`{count}`) are in the translated text.
A simple check, one that ensures that placeholders in translated text can
always be filled in. This script can also check for other conventions you want
to uphold in your translatable text. For example, you may not want to use empty
placeholders `{}` or explicitly check for `%`-based placeholders. In our case
we also check for HTML entities (e.g. &amp;lt;).

Adding these tests will help us ensure that a future mistake in a translation
file that could prevent Gaphor from launching, will be caught automatically.

#### Notes

1. <a name="note1"></a>This is actually a template string in Javascript. It
   takes some extra effort to make those translatable.
