[GTK](https://gtk.org) is a cross-platform toolkit. It's a key component for the
[GNOME desktop](https://gnome.org), [GIMP](https://gimp.org),
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), and many other high quality open source
desktop applications. GTK 4 is the most recent major version, the long awaited
successor of GTK+ 3. For desktop applications there's a lot to gain by porting
to GTK 4. First and foremost because GTK 4 takes full support of your GPU.

For Gaphor we provide binaries for Linux, Windows and macOS. 

GTK 4 no longer maps its keyboard shortcuts to macOS native keybindings. While
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is used on Linux and Windows, <kbd>Command</kbd> is used on
macOS as primary modifier key. Although that's inconvenient, it's not as bad as
it sounds.

## Why care about macOS

Let's take a step back. Why should we even care about macOS as a target platform?

For our project it is a must to run on all platforms. Gaphor is a tool that
requires collaboration, and we do not want to leave out Windows and macOS users.
After all, macOS is a popular platform for software development.

We want to let as many people as possible use and experience open source
software. Therefore, we can't simply build an application only for Linux: it
would exclude a lot of potential users. By bringing the software to their
platform, they can experience what it is to use open source
software<sup>[1](#footnotes)</sup>.

For Gaphor there are many benefits upgrading the macOS binary to GTK 4: the
responsiveness of the application improves _a lot_. A whole lot. GTK 4 runs as
fast as a native macOS application.

## Application defined shortcuts

For shortcuts that we define in our application, we're in control.

In GTK the <kbd>Command</kbd> key is represented by the `Meta` keyboard modifier.

GTK+ 3 has a keyboard modifier called `<Primary>`. It maps to <kbd>Command</kbd>
on macOS and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> on Linux and Windows. In GTK 4, `<Primary>` is an
alias for `<Control>`. There's good reason the GTK developers want to drop the
`Primary` key modifier: the translation from Linux to macOS key bindings is not
as simple as switching <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> for <kbd>Command</kbd>. For example:
where Linux uses <kbd>Home</kbd> to move the cursor to the beginning of a line,
macOS uses <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>‚Üê</kbd>.

There are still a lot of common shortcuts, for example for saving
(<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd>) and opening files (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd>).
For those cases we can simply reinstate the old `Primary` behavior:

```python
def platform_specific_modifier(shortcut):
    """Shortcuts are written like `<Primary>s`.
    """
    return shortcut.replace(
        "<Primary>",
        "<Meta>" if sys.platform == "darwin" else "<Control>"
    )

def new_shortcut(shortcut, detailed_name):
    return Gtk.Shortcut.new(
        trigger=Gtk.ShortcutTrigger.parse_string(platform_specific_modifier(shortcut)),
        action=Gtk.NamedAction.new(detailed_name),
    )

...
new_shortcut("<Primary>s", "win.save-file")
```

## Built-in widgets

For built-in widget, we have to use a different strategy. The keyboard shortcuts
are defined on a class level. GTK's own classes. Subclassing does not help us.

We do not try to map _all_ shortcuts, only the important ones: copy/paste,
undo/redo, cursor navigation.

Thanks to the modular design of GTK 4, only two widgets need some extra
shortcuts: [Gtk.Text](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Text.html) and
[Gtk.TextView](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.TextView.html). The existing
shortcuts are not in the way, so they can remain as is.

Although it's recommended to add keyboard shortcuts during class construction,
you can also add shortcuts on class level after the class has been created.

```python
def new_shortcut_with_args(shortcut, signal, *args):
    shortcut = Gtk.Shortcut.new(
        trigger=Gtk.ShortcutTrigger.parse_string(shortcut),
        action=Gtk.SignalAction.new(signal),
    )
    if args:
        shortcut.set_arguments(GLib.Variant.new_tuple(*args))
    return shortcut


Gtk.TextView.add_shortcut(
    new_shortcut_with_args(
        "<Meta>a", "select-all",
        GLib.Variant.new_boolean(True)
    )
)
```

To find the right shortcuts to map, I had a look at the [GTK source
code](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/) and the documentation on [Mac
keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236). The translation
to macOS shortcuts is really straight forward.

If you want to know how it's implemented in Gaphor, have a look at our [macOS
shim module](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/blob/main/gaphor/ui/macosshim.py).

## Closing thought

When you port an application to another platform, there is always a bit of
custom code involved. That's not a problem. It's a chance to tailor the user
experience to the target platform. Providing a good user experience is crucial
to attract and retain users.
