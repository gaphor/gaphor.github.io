On February 16, 2024, we released Gaphor 2.24.

It's been quite a while since I produced a proper updates post.

Since the 2.17 release about a year before, a lot has changed.

<!--break-->

We completely dropped GTK+ 3 support. The application is using the latest UI
widgets from the [GTK 4](https://gtk.org) toolkit and
[LibAdwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/1.4/).
In general this makes it easier to build and style the UI. Also, GTK 4 is a lot
more responsive on Windows and macOS.

## Merge conflict resolution

Merge conflicts can be resolved by Gaphor. If you want to merge changes made in a branch

![Resolve merge conflicts](/images/gaphor-2.24/merge-conflict-window.png)

Documentation can be found on our [documentation site](https://docs.gaphor.org/en/latest/merge_conflicts.html).

## Application settings

We added a few application wide settings: the UI language can be set to English,
instead of system language; the application appearance (dark/light/system) can be
set from within the application.

## Diagrams

We also improved diagram style settings, and now you can customize individual parts within an item on a diagram.

You can also add diagrams (as icons) on a diagram. Double-clicking the diagram will open it.
This is quite convenient if you want to add an interactive overview or navigation diagram.

The language for the model can be changed independent of the UI language.
This makes it possible to use terms such as stereotype names in the same language as the model.

A few new graphical elements are introduced:

* (SysML) Information Flow for Associations
* (SysML) New item: Interface Block
* (SysML) Support for Allocations
* (UML) New items: Value Specification Action, and Call Behavior Action
* A number of elements (such as properties, lifelines) can be assigned a type.


## Challenges

One trouble we haven't been able to resolve is virus warnings on Windows. Ironically, Windows
is the only platform where we build the whole application from source, except for Python.
We haven't figured out how to deal with this in a consistent manner. All help is welcome including
reporting false positives to the virus scanner companies.
