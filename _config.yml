# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.url }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

tagline: Gaphor, the UML/SysML modeling tool
description: >-
    Gaphor is a UML, SysML, RAAML, and C4 modeling application written in Python. It is
    designed to be easy to use, while still being powerful. Gaphor implements a
    fully-compliant UML 2 data model, so it is much more than a picture drawing
    tool. You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects of a system
    as well as create complete, highly complex models.
